Requirement:

Develop an application that would allow the user to play a lottery game.
The game should generate 6 random secret lottery numbers between 1 and 40. Once the numbers have been chosen, the user should be permitted to enter up to three lines of 6 numbers each. These numbers should then be compared to the secret lottery numbers one line at a time.  A lottery line is successful according to the criteria shown in Table 1:

Table 1 Lottery rules
Numbers matched on a line	Winnings
3 numbers 	€125
4 numbers	€300
5 numbers	€1,500
6 numbers	Won the Lottery

The application should allow the user to play the loterry game as many times as they want.

At the end of a game, the game should display the amount of numbers guessed correctly on each line played. Once a game has finished, the application asks the player if he/she would like to play another game. At the end of all the games, display a history of all games played. The history shows, for each game, the number of lines played, and the number of lines won, and the total winnings. Also, at the end of all the games, display a summary with the total number of games played and the average of winnings across all the games. All the history elements of the game should be coded using arrays. 

For example, the history at the end of a game could be: if the secret lottery numbers are 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12 and the user entered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on their first line, and 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13 on their second line and 10, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 on their third line, the program should output to the user: You guessed 3 numbers on line 1, 4 numbers on line 2 and 0 numbers on line 3.

Application Development:
To solve this problem, you shall form a group of 3 people.

Project Deliverables and Submission Information:
•	The project will be submitted to Moodle on week 12. Please check Moodle for deadline.
•	You need to submit only once per project team.
•	The project submission should include a project report outlining very clearly who has coded which part of the code. The report should include a description of the input, main processing and output (IPO). Any decisions you take in designing and implementing your project should be specified in the report. 
•	A separate submission of a short summary that outlines the tasks contributed to the project be each team member is required to be submitted by each team member.
•	The code should be commented to explain what the code is doing. The code should follow good programming practice e.g. naming conventions, indentations.
•	A test will take place following the submission of your group project. This test will include questions based on the topic of the project and submitted application. Please check Moodle for the exact date of the in-class test.
